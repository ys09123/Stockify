Stock Price Prediction Dashboard
This project is a web application that allows users to visualize and predict the stock prices of various companies using historical data and machine learning models. The dashboard provides interactive charts, tables, and widgets to explore the trends and patterns of the stock market.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Streamlit 1.0 or higher
Pandas 1.3 or higher
Numpy 1.21 or higher
Scikit-learn 0.24 or higher
TensorFlow 2.6 or higher
Matplotlib 3.4 or higher
Plotly 5.3 or higher
You can install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, you can use a virtual environment such as conda or venv.

Usage
To launch the dashboard, run the following command in your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

This will open a browser window with the dashboard. You can select a company from the sidebar and see its historical stock price data in the main panel. You can also adjust the time range, the frequency, and the indicators using the widgets.

To predict the future stock price, click on the “Predict” button in the sidebar. This will show you a plot of the actual and predicted stock prices for the next 30 days, as well as the mean absolute error and the root mean squared error of the prediction. You can choose between different machine learning models, such as linear regression, support vector regression, and long short-term memory (LSTM).
